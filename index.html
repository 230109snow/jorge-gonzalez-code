        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

        <p>My name is Jorge Gonzalez.</p>

        <p>Learning is one of the biggest sources of joy in my life.</p>
        <p>I get really big bursts of joy when I learn how to do something new, like how to build a new data structure or solve a really difficult programming problem I've been stuck on.</p>
        <p>Or, when I learn a cool new fact, like the fact that the atoms that make up our bodies were birthed in the wombs of stars, so we're literally made of star dust.</p>
        <p>Or, when I'm introduced to a new abstract idea, something I've never thought about that blows my mind.</p>
        <p>Knowing there's so much yet to learn is what keeps me going.</p>
